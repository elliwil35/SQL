Using SQL, I explored the data to see if international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population.

SELECT stay, 
	COUNT(*) as count_int,
	ROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS average_phq,
	ROUND(AVG(tosc), 2) AS average_scs,
	ROUND(AVG(toas), 2) as average_as
FROM students 
WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter'
GROUP BY stay
ORDER BY stay DESC;
