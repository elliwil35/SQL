#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to explore the ratings, genres, and the box office performances of the popular movies.

First I wanted to see the top 10 movies based on IMDB rating

SELECT * FROM imdb
ORDER BY rating desc LIMIT 10

Then I wanted to see movies that had a metacritic score of 80 or above

SELECT * imdb
WHERE Metacritic > 80

I explore another table in the dataset which contain the different movie genre.

SELECT * FROM genre

Then I wanted to see what the title of movie, the rating of the movie and the genre of the movie.

SELECT title,rating,genre
FROM imdb
INNER JOIN genre ON imdb.movie_id = genre.Movie_id

Finally, I wanted to see the top 10 movies based on the earnings worldwide. 


SELECT title, worldwide
FROM imdb
LEFT JOIN earning ON imdb.movie_id = earning.Movie_id
ORDER BY worldwide desc LIMIT 10
